# HCI


New hypotheses:
H1: Visual-haptic congruence has little effect on performance, mainly affecting subjective ratings.

H2: Haptic weight drives movement: light feels → slower, cautious; heavy feels → faster, confident.

H3: Mismatch asymmetry: heavy-looking/light-feeling objects → more corrections/overshoots than light-looking/heavy-feeling.

H4: Congruent conditions are rated more realistic than incongruent ones.




I have uploaded:
1 - `performance.py`: Does analysis on participants combined.
2 - `realism.py`: Does analysis on realism ratings.
3 - `combine.py`: Combines all files into one, analyzes participant data, runs corrected statistical tests, visualizes results, and saves a summary.
