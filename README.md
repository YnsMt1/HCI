## Hypotheses

- **H1:** Visual–haptic congruence has little effect on performance, primarily influencing subjective ratings.
- **H2:** Perceived haptic weight drives movement behavior:
  - Light-feeling objects → slower, more cautious movements  
  - Heavy-feeling objects → faster, more confident movements
- **H3:** Mismatch asymmetry:
  - Heavy-looking / light-feeling objects produce more corrections and overshoots than light-looking / heavy-feeling objects.
- **H4:** Congruent visual–haptic conditions are rated as more realistic than incongruent conditions.
